								Imagine, if you will, that your Aunt Sophie, whose eyesight is now mostly diminished, goes out shopping alone. She is independent and gets to the store without a problem, but in order to buy items that match her kitchen decor, she'll need  help from someone in the store.
							</p>
								<p>
									This is not a problem I would have expected to be so common had I not visited some blind and visually-impaired people and asked them about some of their most common daily difficulties. Picking out home decor at IKEA stood out as a problem we could solve within our six-week time span. My team, Adappt, and I originally sought to design a wayfinding tool for blind and visually-impaired users to navigate unfamiliar buildings. It didn't take long for us to realize that the market is flooded with wayfinding apps and, honestly, wayfinding is one of the first things blind people become good at. Some tasks, like matching fabrics, shopping at Costco, or asking a stranger for help and hoping they will be friendly remain difficult despite the myriad of wayfinding apps. 
									</p>
									<p>
									To kick off our design process, we conducted some ethnographic research, developed some personas, and then brainstormed roughly 50 ideas, ranging from geofence technology to audiomaps. Sketching some of my favorite ideas helped me determine which ones would be most feasible.

								<h3>Getting the ball rolling</h3>
								<p>
									From the moment we decided on the Assist idea, we had four weeks to design, test, iterate, and present a final prototype. Initially, I struggled to figure out where to begin. Drawing on what's now one of my personal design principles--"Shut up; just draw!"--I forced myself to begin sketching out some paper prototypes. By getting the initial ideas on paper, I began to visualize the application and caught myself on a number of flaws in my thinking right off the bat, such as side menu placement and bottom navigation items. My finalized lo-fi prototype is shown below as an animated gif.

								<h3>Making it accessible</h3>
								<p>
									Assist consists of two separate interfaces--one for blind users and one for sighted volunteers. The idea is that sighted users log in and go on standby. Meanwhile, if a blind user needs assistance, she enters the details of her request, how long she expects it to take, and sends out a ping to nearby volunteers, who may accept or decline the request. Designing the sighted user interface was pretty straightforward, but in order to properly test the paper prototype for blind users, we had to properly simulate accessibility tools like screenreaders. My teammate Brittany, who regularly works with screenreaders, helped us develop a script that we read as our test users gestured. Designing for screenreaders posed many design conundrums: the most visually sensible layout often contradicts the quickest flow when examining items from top to bottom and left to right.

								<h3>Testing it out</h3>
								<p>
									Watch as we tested out the accessible prototype (with screen reader) on one of many participants who helped us. In this session, I played the hands switching pages in and out.

									<ul>
                                    	<li>Establish trust by proactively warning users of courtesy and etiquette upon signing up</li>
                                        <li>Establish more trust by allowing users to filter by ratings and restrict users with low ratings</li> 
                                        <li>Loading screens matter--even on a paper prototype</li>
                                        <li>Radio buttons are very ineffective for screen readers</li>
                                        <li>Timers and dynamic actions are difficult to test on paper and often need additional tweaking after the first hi-fi prototype</li>
